----

The Tableau Server installer on Windows uses a wizard-like approach to installing and configuring Tableau server. This approach works well for many users and administrators, but limits the ability to perform automated deployments using tools like Chef or Puppet.

We are providing some reference implementations to show users and organizations how they can automate deployment of Tableau Server on Windows, using scripts to prepare the installation and run the installer executable with appropriate command-line arguments.  

See also [Automated Installation of Tableau Server](http://onlinehelp.tableau.com/v10.5/server/en-us/server_install_unattended.htm) for general documentation regarding these scripts.

For a reference implementation of automating the deployment of Tableau Server to AWS using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), please see the [Tableau Server on AWS Quick Start](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/tableau-server/).

Please use 'Issues' to note any bugs or make suggestions.  

Getting Started
---------------
This repository includes a sample Python script for performing installs and/or upgrades of Tableau Server.  This script supports both single and multi-node instances of Tableau Server. We have also included several samples of the input files to the installer script.

<a name="ScriptedInstaller"></a> ScriptedInstaller.py
----
This is a reference Python script to install or upgrade Tableau Server.

### Requirements
This script targets Python version 2.7.12. It also requires the PyYaml module which can be installed as follows:

`pip install pyyaml`

### Usage examples

The script has two "modes"; _install_ and _upgrade_ ; each mode can have several arguments.

For a new install:

`python ScriptedInstaller.py install --installerLog C:\Temp\tabinstall.txt --installDir C:\TableauServer --secretsFile secrets.json --configFile myconfig.yml --registrationFile registration.json --licenseKey THIS-IS-MYLI-CENS-EKEY Setup-Server-x64.exe`

*Special Note: When doing an installation on a distributed cluster, you will need to first run the Tableau Server Worker Installer on each worker machine and use the /PRIMARYIP switch to specify the IP Address/Hostname of the primary machine. Then run the Python script as shown above on the primary once all the software has been successfully installed on all workers.*

For an upgrade:

`python ScriptedInstaller.py upgrade --fastuninstall --installerLog C:\Temp\tabupgrade.txt --installDir C:\TableauServer  Setup-Server-x64.exe`

The script currently only supports upgrading a single-node server from version 9.0.x or higher, or a cluster from version 9.3.x or higher.


### Script arguments

#### _install_ mode

Option|Argument|Required|Description
----|----------|---------|-------
--installDir|[FILE PATH]|Optional|The Tableau installation directory. The software binaries, configuration, and data will all live in a a directory tree rooted here. _If omitted, the default directory C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau Server will be used for the binaries, and configuration and data will live under C:\ProgramData\Tableau_
--configFile|[FILE PATH]|Optional|Path to a .yml [Server Configuration File](#ConfigFile) (relative or absolute) describing the Tableau Server configuration. This file's content is the same as the tabsvc.yml file. _If this argument is omitted, all Tableau defaults will be used for configuration._
--installerLog|[FILE PATH]|Optional|Path to where the installer executable should write its log file. The directory must already exist. _If omitted, the log will be written under the user's TEMP directory._
--enablePublicFwRule||Optional|Use this to specify that a firewall rule to enable connections to the Gateway process (if configured to be created at all), should also be enabled on the Windows "public" profile. _If omitted, the firewall rule, if created at all, will default to the private and domain profiles only._
--secretsFile|[FILE PATH]|**Required**|Path to a .json file (relative or absolute) that describes both the credentials of the Windows account that Tableau Server will run as, and the username/password of the initial admin user for Tableau Server.  See [Secrets File](#SecretsFile) for more information.
--registrationFile|[FILE PATH]|**Required**|Path to a .json file (relative or absolute) describing the Tableau Server registration information. See [Server Registration File](#RegFile) for more information.
--licenseKey|[KEY]|**Required***|Your server license key, acquired through the usual channels.
--trialLicense||**Required***|Use trial license (not valid for cluster setup)
(installer executable)|[FILE PATH]|**Required**|The final argument to the script is simply the path, absolute or relative, to the Tableau Server installer executable, acquired through usual channels such as downloaded from the Tableau Website. _This script is only supported for use with Tableau Server v10.1 and higher._ 
\* ***One and only one of --licenseKey or --trialLicense must be used***

#### _upgrade_ mode

A quick note: the same installer executable used to perform a fresh install is used to perform an upgrade. The word 'install' in this section can be considered synonymous with 'upgrade'

Option|Argument|Required|Description
----|----------|---------|-------
--installDir|[FILE PATH]|Optional|The current Tableau installation directory. The software binaries, configuration, and data will all live in a a directory tree rooted here. If the script does not find an existing installation at this directory, it will abort. _If omitted, the default directory C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau Server will be used for the binaries, and configuration and data will live under C:\Program Data\Tableau_
--secretsFile|[FILE PATH]|Optional|Path to a .json file (relative or absolute) that describes the credentials of the Windows account that Tableau Server runs as.  This is needed for an upgrade if you are not using the default Run As user account. See [Secrets File](#SecretsFile) for more information.
--installerLog|[FILE PATH]|Optional|Path to where the installer executable should write its log file. The directory must already exist. _If omitted, the log will be written under the user's TEMP directory._
--fastuninstall| |Optional|  If specified, this will perform the upgrade using the /FASTUNINSTALL switch, which skips creating a backup before performing the upgrade (which uninstalls the old version and then installs the new version). This greatly speeds up the upgrade process; consider using this if you already have a recent backup or feel particularly lucky today. _If omitted, the upgrade process will not use /FASTUNINSTALL and a backup will be created before the upgrade is performed__
(installer_executable)|[FILE PATH]|**Required**|The final argument to the script is simply the path, absolute or relative, to the Tableau Server installer executable, acquired through usual channels such as downloaded from the Tableau Website. _This script is only supported for use with Tableau Server v10.1 and higher._ 

### Input File Samples 

#### <a name="SecretsFile"></a> Secrets file example
```
{
	"runas_user":"workgroup\\serviceuser",
	"runas_pass":"password",
	"content_admin_user":"admin",
	"content_admin_pass":"password"
}
```
If _runas_user_ is not set, the system will use the Windows built-in user _NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE_. If _runas_pass_ is not set, the system will assume the password is blank. In the case where the server is being upgraded, these credentials describe the user the server should run as after the upgrade; normally, these will be the same credentials as when the server was installed. If this file is not specified, the system assumes the runas username hasn't changed and the password is blank.

The _content_admin_user_ is the initial administrative user, who acts as a superuser for all of Tableau Server with respect to creating and managing users, sites, etc. In the case where the server is being upgraded, these credentials are ignored because the initial admin user has already been created.

Hint: To install a server with the same configuration as an existing server, you can just copy the contents of the existing server's _tabsvc.yml_ file. By default this is located in `C:\ProgramData\Tableau\Tableau Server\config`. If generating your own configuration file, you will need to add the _config.version:_ (15 for 10.1) so the server can handle any conversions, updates, or configuration options.

### Known Issues/Troubleshooting

* If you use the `--configfile` option to specify a custom configuration file, verify that the .yml file that you provide is valid for your Tableau Server installation.  Pay special attention that hostnames and IP addresses match those of the cluster that you are deploying to.
* Upgrades using the Python script only work for upgrades from version 9.0.x and higher for a single-node server, or version 9.3.x and higher for a cluster.  For previous version of Tableau Server, you will need to first uninstall Tableau Server from the primary machine and all worker machines.  Then, proceed as you would for a multi-node install of Tableau Server.
